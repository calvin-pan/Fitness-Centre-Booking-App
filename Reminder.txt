Update edit class methods in instructor dialogs and homeactivity to account
For new ENROLLMENT database in members. When a class is edited by an instructor
The change should be consistent through all currently enrolled members.
Issues to think around: What happens if an edit puts a members classes in conflict?
Solution 1: drop the class that was just edited
- remove members enrollment record (since capacity, enrollment etc is all tracked through
Queries of the same database, should only need to make this change to keep
Consistency).

**Instructors should not be able to lower class capacity below the number of currently enrolled members.
